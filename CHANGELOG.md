## [1.2.0] - 2025-05-06
### Added
- Expose Botania mana costs and Thermal Expansion RF bars through reusable virtual ingredient types, with one shared ingredient id per resource type, recipe-specific tooltip text staying on the exported hotspot, and correct produce-vs-consume indexing for the exported ingredient pages. Any integration can expose arbitrary virtual ingredients via integration/, which the frontend will handle generically.
- Allow tooltip query zones to be defined from JSON files under `config/jeidump/integrations/<modid>/`, so non-slot JEI hints can be configured for any loaded mod without adding new Java integrations.

### Fixed
- Make recipe grids size columns from each category's actual image width, which prevents wide recipe cards from bleeding into adjacent columns while keeping ultra-wide screens from over-packing narrow recipes.


## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-05
### Added
- Add a "last updated" timestamp to the footer, showing when the dump was generated.
- Add I18n support for the website and a language selector to switch between available translations. The command feedback messages are now internationalized as well.
- Deduplicate shared recipe backgrounds per category in exported dumps, and layer the shared background below per-recipe foreground PNGs on the website when it reduces the total image size.
- Export arbitrary JEI ingredient types, using JEI's registered ingredient helpers and renderers instead of hardcoded item and fluid handling.

### Fixed
- Fix recipe hotspots reusing the first-seen tooltip for shared ingredient ids, so different stack amounts of the same fluid now show their own correct value.


## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-04
### Fixed
- Fix github link in footer.


## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-04
### Added
